<h1>About the Website</h1>
Critical rationalism is a cool philosophy invented by cool people. It started in the mid-20th century with the publication of Karl Popper's <i>Conjectures and Refutations</i> and has a vast range of applications: epistemology, philosophy of science, economics, politics, physics, mathematics, even artificial intelligence. Here are some questions which interest critical rationalists:
<ul>
  <li>What differentiates science from non-science? What characteristics identify good science?</li>
  <li>What is creativity?</li>
  <li>How can our society be reformed in light of these ideas?</li>
  <li>How does evolution -- be it through genes or memes -- affect human societies?</li>
</ul>
The site primarily hosts quotes from Oxford University physicist David Deutsch, who is a prominent critical rationalist. The quotes are organized into a dictionary, which is searchable and can be viewed at random. The dictionary is a work in progress, and I (<a href="https://www.vkethana.com">Vijay Kethana</a>) hope to add more quotes and authors in the future. Besides David Deutsch, here are some other people whose quotes/tweets I plan to add to the dictionary:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/ToKTeacher">Brett Hall</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://nav.al">Naval</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/dela3499">Carlos de la Guardia</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/reasonisfun">Lulie Tanett</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/DKedmey">David Kedmey</a></li>
</ul>
<h1>Resources to Learn More</h1>
If you're looking to learn more about epistemology, the best place to start is David Deutsch's <a href="https://amzn.to/3vkQ6ln"><i>The Beginning of Infinity</i></a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/3PxYk0r"><i>The Fabric of Reality</i></a>. Investor Naval Ravikant has put up a set of podcast episodes (<a href="https://nav.al/deutsch-files-i">The Deutsch Files</a>) covering these topics in more depth.
Here are some more suggestions by topic:
<ul>
  <li><b>Computer Science</b>: <a href="https://amzn.to/4aagFc3"><i>Godel, Escher, Bach</i></a> by Douglas Hofstadter</li>
  <li><b>Human History</b>: <a href="https://amzn.to/4cqIX3A"><i>The Ascent of Man</i></a> by Jacob Bronowski</li>
  <li><b>Economics</b>: <a href="https://amzn.to/3x5KWKD"><i>Economics in One Lesson</i></a> by Henry Hazlitt (Deutsch doesn't recommend this book, but Hazlitt's arguments are astonishingly "Popperian")</li>
</ul>
